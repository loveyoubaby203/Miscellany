I was a creative and dedicated web developer who excels in optimizing the performance of user-centric, high-impact websites for nationwide and global companies. I completely revamped the face of many NFT marketing sites and switched it to React & Vue, improving site stickiness by 23%, and drastically reducing marketing expenditure.
But today blockchain is revolutionizing industries including fintech, real estate, and supply chain management.
Many excellent software engineers and coders are diving into blockchain development.
So I rethought my career with blockchain, I studied and researched blockchain myself, and now I can help many clients in blockchain development with high skills.
In the blockchain field, my top skill is smart contract by solidity & rust & Haskell.
Smart contracts are programmed contracts that utilize execution in a distributed environment for enforceability, and these can be used to support crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets, and more.
I had already built and published many fungible & non-fungible tokens with the standard smart contracts like ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, BEP20, and CRO20 on some blockchain networks.
I am more interested in blockchain game development than in cryptocurrencies.
I had already developed "dice" & "zombie's war" blockchain game by solidity and javascript on bsc network.
Unity3D is another skill that I can brag about.
Mastering the metaverse blockchain game is my next goal.
I will do my best for this milestone, with a burning passion for blockchain and the gaming world.
Thanks.
Zoran.
